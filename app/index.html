      Kil'jaeden (pronounced Kill-Jay-Den) was a powerful eredar demon lord and acting leader of the Burning Legion. Appointed twenty-five thousand years ago as the chief lieutenant of Sargeras, he had the same rank as Archimonde.[3][4][5] While Archimonde led the Legion's armies, Kil'jaeden's agenda was to assimilate every race possible into the folds of the Burning Legion. He was responsible for manipulating Gul'dan and the creation of the tyrannical Lich King from the spirit of the shaman Ner'zhul. Since the apparent banishment of Sargeras and the death of Archimonde, he had assumed the role of supreme commander; in the end he was defeated by the heroes in orbit above Argus. Before his death, the Deceiver finally made amends with his brother figure, Velen.
